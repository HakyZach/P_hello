# Overview

The purpose of this code is to simply display text using the Python coding language.

This code consists only of a simple pront statement in order to display "Hello World" in the terminal when the code is run.

{The purpose of this prject was to refresh my knowledge of creating and adding to a GitHub repository by adding a simple project to a new repository.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
